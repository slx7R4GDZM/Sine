# Sine
Sine is an unfinished remake of Asteroids that I've made using C++ and [SFML](https://github.com/SFML/SFML).

## Compiling
Sine was designed to compile with SFML 2.4.2 under MinGW-w64 7.1.0 POSIX Threads using the C++14 flag.

## What's with the Strange Constants?
The vector and text constants were made with [Sine Toolkit](https://github.com/slx7R4GDZM/Sine-Toolkit).
